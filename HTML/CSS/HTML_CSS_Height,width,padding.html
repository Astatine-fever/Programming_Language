            Flash sales and promotions are the top reasons people opt in to text messages from businesses.<br> 
            If you’re running a promotion and want your customers to take action immediately,<br> 
            there’s hardly a more proven method of getting the word out than text.<br> 
            You’re almost guaranteed a sharp boost in revenue and quick returns on your investment.

            Start by offering your customers a reward when they text in a keyword.<br> 
            This message can appear as a pop-up on your website with a widget that <br>
            directly inputs the keyword on their text messaging app.
